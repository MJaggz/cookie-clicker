Cookie Clicker Game :)

A browser-based Cookie Clicker game built with React, JavaScript, and CSS to practice frontend development through an interactive and fun project.

The game features manual clicking, upgrade mechanics, auto clickers, and real time counter animations. I focused on clean component structure, responsive UI, and smooth state updates. To add a playful touch, I integrated the Official Joke API to keep the experience light and engaging.

This project helped me strengthen my React fundamentals, state management, and UI/UX thinking while building something enjoyable end to end.
